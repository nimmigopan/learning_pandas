Pandas is an open-source Python library that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for data manipulation and analysis. 
It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and other data-related fields for tasks such as data cleaning, exploration, transformation, and analysis. 
Pandas is built on top of NumPy, which makes it a powerful tool for working with structured data.
